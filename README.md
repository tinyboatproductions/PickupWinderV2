# PickupWinderV2
A DIY pickup winder for making handwound guitar pickups

I set out to design this to make a cheap pickup winder after looking at many of the low cost that are still out of my budget. 
This was desined to use easy to access components and a 3D printed case.

Also this is my first time really using GitHub so please excuse all my messy commits. 

Thanks,
TBP
